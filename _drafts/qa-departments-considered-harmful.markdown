Testing Services, QA Department, Testing Centre of Excellence.

Sound familiar?

These are all names that refer to a centralised testing capability in large organisations.

They are set up to provide a flexible resource pool of people that "know how to do testing", and the testers are staffed into project teams, with costs charged back to the delivery team requiring them.

Commonly, delivery teams have to use these organisations, because the knowledge required to ship software to production is holed up in the minds of the people within - what signoffs release management require, report formats, prior know-how about the systems, and sometimes crucially, the team that maintains a suite of automated tests.

There are several problems associated with this organisational model. I'll try and address each in turn, and finish up with the benefits of an alternative approach.

1. The 0.5 person and single points of failure

Scarce skills, such as performance testing, needed in small quantities across many teams are often solved by spreading the time of a small group of experts across multiple projects.

This form of what I term 'people coupling' allows each project to unintentionally eat the lunch of all the others through strain on their shared individual, and the person becomes a single point of failure, where getting sick simulataneously risks all projects.

Sometimes the skills are both rare in the market, and rare in the organisation

Spikes or failures in any one consumer of the resources does not impact the performance of the others.
